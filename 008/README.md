# 008 Small Bilingual Lexicon

## Pickle

- Represent a small bilingual lexicon as a Python dictionary in the following fashion:
  {**'merry':'god'**, **'christmas':'jul'**, **'and':'och'**, **'happy':'gott'**, **'new':'nytt'**, **'year':'Ðµr'**}
- Use it to translate your Christmas cards from English into Swedish.
- That is, write a function:
  - **translate()** - that takes a list of English words and returns a list of Swedish words.
