# Pickled Brain

A problem for each day.

## Structure

- each Pickle has a README file with description of the problem
- each Pickle has a /default folder that contains a tests file and boilerplate solution file

## How to Start a New Pickle

- copy a /default folder and rename it with your name
- modify solution file with right and good code (no bad code please)

## How to Test Your Solution

- copy test.py from /default folder to your solution folder
- in your solution folder run following command run tests (or right click -> Run in PyCharm):
```
> python tests.py
```

- if all tests have passed then you did a good work. If not get out.

## How to Submit Your Solution

- just commit it to github
