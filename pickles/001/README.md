# 001 Calculator. The Beginning

## Background
You are assigned to write your own calculator class for a new project. For now you decided to write addition, subtraction, multiplication and division functions.

## Pickle
- create a "add" function that adds two numbers so
```python
print add(1, 5) # 6
```

- create a "subtract" function that subtracts two numbers
```python
print subtract(10, 14) # -4
```

- create a "multiply" function that miltiplies two numbers
```python
print multiply(3, 12) # 36
```

- create a "divide" function that divides two numbers
```python
print divide(12, 4) # 3
```

- don't forget to check if input is numeric (integer)

## Solution
In /solutions make copy of /default folder and rename it with you name. Modify pickle001.py file to submit a solution.

## Testing
In your solution folder run following command to test it:
```
> python tests.py
```

If all tests are passed then you did a good work.

## Parameters
language=python
tags=functions, math, unit tests
